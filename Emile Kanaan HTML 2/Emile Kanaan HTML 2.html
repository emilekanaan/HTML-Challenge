    <h2 id="content"><b>Today </b>we are going to talk about music</h2>
    <p><q><b>Music</b> is generally defined as the <i>art of arranging sound to create some combination of form</i>,
            harmony, melody,
            rhythm or otherwise expressive content.[1][2][3] Exact definitions of music vary considerably around the
            world,[4] <sup>though it is an aspect of all human societies</sup>, a cultural universal.[5] While scholars
            agree that
            music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions.[6] The
            creation
            of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance,[7]
            though
            the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. Music may be
            performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice.
            <br>
            In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, in
            Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure
            and
            using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz the performers may take turns leading and responding, while
            sharing a
            changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer
            acting
            at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable, or agglomerated electronically
            from
            many performances. Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals,
            rock
            concerts, and orchestra performance, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV
            show,
            opera, or video game. Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player and a universal
            feature of radios and smartphones.
            <br>
            Music often plays a key role in social activities, religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies,
            celebrations,
            and cultural activities. The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers,
            tour
            organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and
            recordings are assessed and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as
            amateurs. </q></p>

    <h3>Etymology and terminology</h3>
    <p><q>The modern English word 'music' came into use in the 1630s.[8] It is derived from a long line of successive
            precursors: the Old English 'musike' of the mid-13th century; the Old French musique of the 12th century;
            and the Latin mūsica.[9][10][n 1] The Latin word itself derives from the Ancient Greek mousiké
            (technē)—μουσική (τέχνη)—literally meaning "(art) of the Muses".[9][n 2] The Muses were nine deities in
            Ancient Greek Mythology who presided over the arts and sciences.[13][14] They were included in tales by the
            earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod,[15] and eventually came to be associated with music
            specifically.[14] Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the other muses.[11]
            The Latin word musica was also the originator for both the Spanish música and French musique via spelling
            and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the Italian
            musica, German musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muzïka.[14]
            <br>
            The modern Western world usually defines music as an all-encompassing term, used to describe diverse genres,
            styles and traditions.[16] This is not the case worldwide, and languages such as modern Indonesian (musik)
            and Shona (musakazo) have recently adopted words to reflect this universal conception, as they did not have
            words that fit exactly the Western scope.[14] In East Asia, neither Japan or China have a single word which
            encompasses music in a broad sense, but culturally often regard music in such a fashion.[17] The closest
            word to mean music in Chinese, yue, shares a character with le, meaning joy, and originally referred to all
            the arts before its narrowing in meaning.[17] Africa is too diverse to make firm generalizations, but the
            musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has emphasized African music's often inseparable connection to dance and
            speech in general.[18] Some African cultures, such as the Songye people of the DRC and Tiv people of
            Nigeria, have a strong and broad conception of 'music' but no corresponding word in their native
            languages.[18] Other words commonly translated as 'music' often have more specific meanings in their
            respective cultures: the Hindi word for music, sangita properly refers to art music,[19] while the many
            Indigenous languages of the Americas have words for music that refer specifically to song but describe
            instrumental music regardless.[20] Though the Arabic musiqi can refer to all music, it is usually used for
            instrumental and metric music, while khandan identifies vocal and improvised music.[21] </q></p>
